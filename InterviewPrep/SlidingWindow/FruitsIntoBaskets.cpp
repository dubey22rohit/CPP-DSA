// Fruits into Baskets(medium)

// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
// you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in
// each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type
// of fruit.
// You can start with any tree,
// but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.You will pick one fruit
// from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
// you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

/**
 * @brief Finds the maximum number of fruits that can be put in two baskets,
 * given an array of characters representing fruit trees.
 *
 * The function uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the array.
 * It maintains a hash map to count the occurrence of each fruit type within the
 * window. If the window contains more than two types of fruits, it shrinks the
 * window from the start. The maximum length of the window (i.e., the maximum
 * number of fruits in both baskets) is tracked.
 *
 * @param arr The array of characters representing fruit trees.
 * @return The maximum number of fruits that can be put in both baskets.

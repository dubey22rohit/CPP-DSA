#### Q1. What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?
> A. O(1)

#### Q2. What are the limitations of arrays?
> A. Arrays have fixed sizes, which can lead to problems if you need to store more elements than the array can hold. Expanding an array usually requires creating a new, larger array and copying elements, which can be inefficient. Additionally, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle, as it requires shifting elements.

#### Q3. What is a slice operation in the context of arrays, and how is it useful?
> A. A slice operation allows you to extract a portion of an array by specifying a range of indices. Slices are valuable for working with subarrays or extracting specific parts of an array without modifying the original array. In Python, for example, you can use slicing like array[start:end] to create a new array containing elements from index start to end-1.

#### Q4. Explain the concept of a dynamic array.
> A. A dynamic array is an array-like data structure that automatically resizes itself when it runs out of space. It typically doubles its size when reaching capacity. Dynamic arrays combine the benefits of arrays (fast indexing) with the flexibility of dynamically allocated memory.


#### Q5. What is a two-dimensional array, and how is it different from a regular array?
> A. 

#### Q6. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
> A. 

#### Q7. How can you reverse the elements of an array in-place?
> A. 

#### Q8. What are some common use cases for arrays in software development?
> A. 

#### Q9. What is the difference between a static array and a dynamic array (e.g., ArrayList in Java, vector in C++)?
> A. 

#### Q10. Explain the concept of a sparse array.
> A. 

#### Q11. What is a jagged array, and how is it different from a regular two-dimensional array?
> A. 

#### Q12. How can you find the maximum and minimum elements in an array efficiently?
> A. 

#### Q13. What is the concept of a circular array, and why might it be useful?
> A. 

#### Q14. What are some potential challenges with cache locality when working with large arrays?
> A. 

#### Q15. What are some common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid when working with arrays in software development?
> A. 

#### Q16. Explain the concept of a multidimensional array. How does it differ from a two-dimensional array?
> A. 

#### Q17. What is the difference between an array and a list in Python?
> A. 

#### Q18. How can you efficiently remove duplicate elements from an unsorted array?
> A. 

#### Q19. What is a "rolling array" or "sliding window" in the context of array manipulation?
> A. 

#### Q20. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using arrays in low-level systems programming?
> A. 

#### Q21. Explain the concept of a "bit array" or "bitset." How is it different from a regular array?
> A. 

#### Q22. How do you implement a resizable array (dynamic array) from scratch?
> A. 

#### Q23. Explain the concept of a "circular buffer" and its applications.
> A. 

#### Q24. What is a "bitmask," and how can it be used with arrays?
> A.
